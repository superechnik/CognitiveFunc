# CognitiveFunc

This is just a small node app.

I don't believe in "cognitive functions" but I was on a discord server and someone said "can anyone make a bot to send out the definitions of these functions"?.
I decided to build it, but never got the definitions, so they are stubbed out.

I hosted the app dockerized on my NAS and it ran fine from the discord channel.

If you wanted to run it, it responds to `! + {func symbol}` like `!Ni`
